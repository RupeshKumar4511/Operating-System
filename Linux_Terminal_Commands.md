# Terminal emulator :
It is a program that allows us to use the terminal in a graphical way.
<br>
Using Terminal we are able  to control our operating system.

# Shell :
It is a command line interface  which interprets our commands and tell the os what to do.
<br>
Command prompt is a part of it.

# Linux Terminal Commands 
How os knows that where is the file exist :
<br>
cmd : where filename 
<br>
This shows the directory of file.

<br>
Note : whenever we write any commands on the terminal then it's first going to check the $PATH environment variable that does the executable file exists here or not.
